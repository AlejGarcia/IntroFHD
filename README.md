# IntroFHD
Introductory materials (notes, Python notebook, etc.) for fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD)

Intro_FHD_notes.pdf - Introduction to fluctuating hydrodynamic (FHD) theory and numerical computations.
                      Presents the stochastic heat equation as a simple FHD example.
                      Also discusses other FHD equations and numerical calculations.

StochasticHeat.ipynb - Python notebook that calculates solution of the stochastic heat equation
                       using either Forward Euler or Predictor-Corrector.
                       See Intro_FHD_notes for documentation
